Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file. 
(We recommend every repository include a README, LICENSE, and .gitignore.)

Using

    Create a new repository on the command line
    echo "# Create-a-Remote-GitHub-Repo-Version-From-a-Local-repo" >> README.md

    git init
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git remote add origin https://github.com/Carole-Ouedraogo/Create-a-Remote-GitHub-Repo-Version-From-a-Local-repo.git
    git push -u origin master
